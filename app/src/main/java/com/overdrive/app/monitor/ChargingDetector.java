/**
 * Fused charging-state detector.
 *
 * Purpose: replace the old polling-only inference path (which produced the
 * "very inconsistent" detection) with an event-driven layered model that
 * fuses three independent BYD HAL signals plus broadcast-receiver edges.
 *
 * Layers, evaluated in order:
 *
 *   L1. BMS state edge (chargingState == 1 CHARGING) — pushed by the
 *       BYDAutoChargingDevice typed listener (onBatteryManagementDeviceStateChanged).
 *       Authoritative when present. The known firmware bug: some PHEV builds
 *       leave this stuck at 15 IDLE while AC charging, so it's not sufficient
 *       on its own.
 *
 *   L2. BYDAutoPowerDevice.isCharging() — independent ground truth from the
 *       power MCU. Polled once per collect cycle. Used as the primary
 *       cross-check that catches the L1 firmware lie.
 *
 *   L3. Power-flow inference — only fires when L1 AND L2 disagree for
 *       {@link #INFERENCE_DISAGREEMENT_MIN_MS}. Requires the gear-in-park
 *       guard, {@link #HYSTERESIS_SAMPLES} distinct observations, and a gun
 *       state that is not CONTRADICTORY: a positive AC/DC assertion (2/3/4),
 *       or UNAVAILABLE accompanied by recent movement on a raw charging
 *       channel. V2L (5) and DISCONNECTED (1) always block — they positively
 *       state the pack is discharging or unplugged. UNAVAILABLE is a dead
 *       accessor rather than evidence against charging, and refusing it left
 *       this layer unable to fire on the very trims it exists to serve (BMS
 *       stuck at IDLE, power MCU unavailable, no gun report).
 *       enginePowerKw is invalidated on ACC OFF, so a stale value from
 *       yesterday's drive cannot retrigger this layer.
 *
 *   Edge inputs: ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED / ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED
 *       transitions are pushed in directly. CONNECTED nudges fusion toward
 *       charging (sets a "plug recently inserted" flag, accelerating L3
 *       hysteresis); DISCONNECTED forces immediate transition to NOT_CHARGING
 *       and clears all sticky power values.
 *
 * Threading: all mutations via synchronized methods; reads return immutable
 * ChargingStateData snapshots.
