     * accessor is used elsewhere both as an EV-only distance (scaled by 0.1) and as

     * catastrophic — an EV-only register on a PHEV, or a 10x scale error, is
     * self-consistent across both trip edges, so it would sail past every
     * downstream sanity check while looking like exact hardware data.
     *
     * <p>So instead of assuming, we CALIBRATE: accept it only if it agrees with the
     * authoritative reading to within that reading's own quantisation. One test
     * rejects a wrong scale, a wrong register, and a resettable trip meter alike.
     *
     * <p>Two details this depends on:
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Compared in raw units.</b> The tolerance is one coarse COUNT, which
     *       is one cluster unit — a mile on a miles cluster. Comparing after the
     *       km conversion would test a 1 km window against a 1.61 km quantum, so a
     *       correct reading would be rejected for ~38% of odometer values.</li>
     *   <li><b>The verdict is STICKY.</b> Whether the fine register is usable is a
     *       property of the vehicle, not of the moment. Re-deciding per read means
     *       the answer can flip as the coarse value rolls over between two reads —
     *       and a trip whose start came from one register and end from the other
     *       produces a delta that is pure garbage yet passes as exact. Decided
     *       once, then honoured for the life of the process. REJECTION additionally
     *       needs {@link #FINE_DISAGREEMENTS_TO_REJECT} consecutive disagreements;
     *       while undecided this returns -1 so the caller uses the authoritative
     *       coarse value.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Synchronized so the check-then-set on the sticky verdict cannot be run
     * concurrently by its callers — the trip edges and the MQTT telemetry cycle. Two
     * threads deciding independently could reach opposite conclusions, which is the
     * very tier split this is meant to prevent. Contention is negligible: the MQTT
     * cycle is floored at its min publish interval, and trips add two calls each.
