/**
 * Per-quadrant detection baseline for filtering static objects from YOLO output.
 *
 * Maintains a "living memory" of what objects are already in the scene so that
 * motion-triggered YOLO detections of static objects (parked cars, trash cans,
 * fire hydrants) are suppressed — only NEW or MOVED objects trigger recording.
 *
 * Update rules:
 * - Seeded once on sentry start (1 YOLO inference per quadrant)
 * - Updated event-driven: at the end of each motion event, the quadrant's
 *   baseline is refreshed from the YOLO detections already computed during
 *   the event. Zero extra inferences.
 * - Refreshed on lighting transitions (dawn/dusk) detected by Stage 1
 *   brightness shift. 1 inference per affected quadrant, 2-3 times per night.
 *
 * Safety rules:
 * - Living things (person, dog, cat, bird) are NEVER promoted to baseline.
 * - Spatial veto: if a detection overlaps with any person detection seen in
 *   the last 60 seconds of the event, it is NOT promoted regardless of class.
 *   This catches misclassification (crouched person labeled as fire hydrant).

     * PASSED the baseline, report the CONFIRMED entry that overlaps it most
     * by CONTAINMENT (intersection area / detection area) — any class,
     * because the two FP signatures under investigation differ:
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>nonperson-pass</b>: a split/reshaped box of a parked car
     *       passes when IoU &lt; {@link #MATCH_IOU_THRESHOLD} and the
     *       foot-point path fails (centroid shift &gt; 4%, w/h ratio &gt;
     *       1.30, or area ratio &gt; 1.15) — but the fragment lies INSIDE
     *       the stored full-car box, so containment stays near 1.0.
     *       Candidate rule under validation: contain &gt;= 0.80 AND same
     *       canonical class =&gt; suppress.</li>
     *   <li><b>person-bypass</b>: part of a parked car misread as a person
     *       bypasses the baseline BY DESIGN (class 0 is never suppressed);
     *       high containment vs a DIFFERENT-class (vehicle) entry is the
     *       misclassification signature.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Purely observational: mutates nothing (stale entries are skipped, not
     * evicted), suppresses nothing. ALWAYS returns a line for a valid call
     * (review fix): a silent no-overlap case would right-censor the
     * containment distribution — "contain=0" and "no baseline to compare
     * against" are data, not noise. Two slots are reported:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code same{...}} — the best SAME-canonical-class entry (by
     *       containment; among zero-overlap entries, nearest foot-point).
     *       This is the entry the candidate suppression rule would score, so
     *       it must never be masked by a larger cross-class overlap (review
     *       fix). Absent for person detections (class 0 is never promoted).</li>
     *   <li>{@code any{...}} / {@code bestOther{...}} — the best entry across
     *       ALL classes when it overlaps more than the same-class one (or
     *       when no same-class entry exists — the person-bypass signature is

     * visible during the day). Lost entries would cause false triggers when
     * headlights later illuminate the "invisible" car.

     * - New detections not in baseline → add them
     * - Existing entries that match a fresh detection → refresh timestamp
     * - Existing entries with no match → keep (YOLO may not see them in new lighting)
     * - Never promote living things
     * - Expired entries (>2 hours) are cleaned up by isInBaseline() lazily
     *
