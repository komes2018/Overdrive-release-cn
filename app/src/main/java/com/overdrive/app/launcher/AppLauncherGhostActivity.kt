/**
 * Transparent, zero-content anchor activity for the split-screen re-dock path.
 *
 * <p>When [AppLauncher] docks an ALREADY-RUNNING app into split-screen it launches
 * this activity with {@code am start --windowingMode 3} (SPLIT_SCREEN_PRIMARY) to
 * force a split-screen-primary stack into existence, then moves the target app's
 * task into that stack. The activity has no UI (never calls setContentView, uses a
 * translucent theme) so it is invisible while it briefly holds the primary half.
 *
 * <p>It self-finishes after a short grace window so it never lingers behind the
 * re-docked app. {@code launchMode=singleInstance} means a rapid second re-dock
 * re-uses this instance and re-runs {@link #onResume}; the finish is scheduled once
 * per resume and guarded so overlapping launches don't stack callbacks or finish an
 * instance that a newer launch is still relying on. Mirrors the transparent
 * LocationStarterActivity pattern already used by the daemon.
