/**
 * Minimal AccessibilityService that keeps the app process alive indefinitely.
 *
 * Android's OOM killer and OEM process killers (including BYD's DiLink firmware)
 * are hardcoded to never kill a process hosting an active AccessibilityService.
 * This gives our app the highest possible process priority — same tier as the
 * keyboard or phone call — preventing the 24-hour kill cycle on newer BYD firmware.
 *
 * Accessibility events are used only to cache the active package for conditional
 * key mappings; no window content is inspected. The foreground notification
 * provides user visibility.
 *
 * On DiLink 3.0 this service can only bind while the app process is already
 * running: BYD's start gate silently refuses the system's bind otherwise, leaving
 * the service in "Binding services" indefinitely. It binds reliably here because
 * the daemon keeps the process alive. See BYD_ACCESSIBILITY_BIND_GATE_DISCOVERY.md.
 *
 * Enable via ADB (one-time):
 *   settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services com.overdrive.app/com.overdrive.app.services.KeepAliveAccessibilityService
 *   settings put secure accessibility_enabled 1
